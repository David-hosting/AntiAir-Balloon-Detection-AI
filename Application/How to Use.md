Diffrent Modes
--------------
There are three ways(mods) to work with this project. These mods are: `Manual, Semi-Auto, Automatic`.<br>
- In `Manual` mode, the user controols everything - from the movemnt of the motor to the actuall shooting
- In `Semi-Auto` mode, the machine learning model will lead the motor and zoom enoght for a good detection but the user will give the athoriztion for the activation of the laser.
- In `Automaic` mode, the machine learning controlls everything, from moving and zooming up to the shooting. In this mode the user cannot control anything and in order for him to gain control back, he must change the mode to one of the other modes.
